Things I would do if I had more time:

1. Add JS to the build process with Webpack.
    - Right now, it's a little overkill to use a bundler like Webpack when I'm not using any modules. Plus, I didn't want to make you guys download a ton of packages just for a couple event listeners.
    - It's ugly keeping the JS out of the `/dist` directory, and I hate it, but... Oh well. It works.
2. Add an event listener to the `document` to close the menu modal when anything outside the menu icon or the menu itself is clicked.
3. Add placeholders for images to prevent FOUC with slow-loading images or slow internet connections.
4. Add transitions on the menu and menu list items.
5. Add hover effects on links.
6. Add very slight fade in/up on content & images (don't want anything too jarring, especially if user prefers-reduced-motion).
7. Improve accessibility (should be #1).
